--LESSON ON SUBQUERIES
--Subqueries mean nested queries, meaning that one query is placed within another to get
--a desired result

--QUERY 1
--Not a sub-query
--A query to display average of all Freight record values in the SalesOrderHeader table
--Displays the result: 676.1196
SELECT avg(Freight)
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader

--QUERY 2
--Not a sub-query
--A query to display the SalesOrderID, Freight, and the average value of Freight that we 
--found out from the previous query entered in the column next to it for comparison
--For every record the constant value of 676.1196 will be displayed in the third column
--This type of query is used for comparison purposes
SELECT SalesOrderID, Freight, 676.1196
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader

--QUERY 3
--In this example we nest query 1 within query 2 to get the same result as query 2
--without having to retrieve the query 1 result, manually enter its value in query 2
--and then run it
SELECT SalesOrderID, Freight, (SELECT avg(Freight) FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader)
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader

--QUERY 4
--Exactly same as query 3 but alias AverageFreight was added as the third column name
--so that the column has a name (previously just said (No column name))
SELECT SalesOrderID, Freight, (SELECT avg(Freight) FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader) AverageFreight
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader
