CREATE DATABASE EmployeeSystem    //creates the database

GO  --batch end. We have to end the batch before creating tables so that the database exists before the tables in that db is created

USE EmployeeSystem	--to go to the db created in previous batch to ensure the tables created below are added within this DB and not in master

CREATE TABLE Department (
	DeptID int NOT NULL,
	DeptName varchar(50) NOT NULL,

	LastName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	DateOfBirth date,

--BATCH: batch creates blocks of queries that need to execute at a time. It is followed by a GO keyword. Batch separates the queries so that 
--they do not run as an all or nothing set. Each batch executes separately, and then moves on to the next batch
--Here create database set of queries has to run in a separate batch than the create table queries, because otherwise the database would not be
--created yet, so we wouldn't be able to create tables within it
