--BATCH: batch creates blocks of queries that need to execute at a time. It is followed by a GO keyword. Batch separates the queries so that 
--they do not run as an all or nothing set. Each batch executes separately, and then moves on to the next batch
--Here create database set of queries has to run in a separate batch than the create table queries, because otherwise the database would not be
--created yet, so we wouldn't be able to create tables within it

--NOTE: each insert into statement automatically executes as a separate batch. So they are batched by default
